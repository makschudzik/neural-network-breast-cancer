## 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook includes the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** — Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and scaling features with StandardScaler.  
- **Model Building** — Constructing a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Training and Validation** — Training the model and monitoring accuracy on both training and test sets.  
- **Evaluation** — Assessing model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), and specificity.  
- **Visualization** — Plotting confusion matrix heatmap and accuracy curves during training.

## 📊 Results

The model achieves high classification accuracy on test data, effectively distinguishing benign from malignant tumors. Metrics such as precision and recall confirm the model's strong predictive capabilities for this medical dataset.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** available directly through scikit-learn's datasets module, so no manual download is required.
